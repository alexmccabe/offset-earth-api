## What's Here

A simple application to fetch data from the Offset Earth API and display it in a Line Chart.

## What's Missing

- Tests
- Filtering date ranges
- Animations
- Nicer UI

## Potential Improvements

- Improve the data visualisation:
  - I could spend more time trying to get a nice X-Axis labelling
  - Better colouring
- More information as to what's happening. It just shows some spinning turbines then pops into view the data
